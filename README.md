# stock-analysis
 <!---- Utilize VBA to analyze stock data --->

## Overview of Project

<!--- Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis. --->

Steve loves the workbook that was prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. While the current solution works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, Steve wonders if it may take a long time to execute.

Steve has tasked us with expanding the solution to include all stocks that Steve would like to analyze. Steve has also asked us to analyze the performance traits of the solution in it's original format and in the newly re-factored format.

## Results

<!--- Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the re-factored script. --->
